Final project for CPEN 291 by Team StyracosaurusðŸ¦–


Use of face masks has become an important part of our life due to COVID-19. Accordingly, there are guidelines outlined by WHO on how to wear a mask correctly.


The goal of this project is to correctly detect masked faces, covering nose, mouth and chin from images using PyTorch's ResNet18 Deep Neural Network architecture.


Currently our model has achieved a train accuracy of 98.14% and a test accuracy of 96.20%. The web app is currently being hosted on Heroku.
